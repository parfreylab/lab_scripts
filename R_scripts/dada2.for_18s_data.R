####BEST PRACTICES FOR DADA2 READ PROCESSING WITH 18S DATA####
#author: Evan Morien
#using and modifying this dada2 guide as necessary: https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/tutorial.html
#last modified: Oct 30th, 2019

####READ FIRST####
#this document is intended as a rough guide for processing 18s metabarcoding data with dada2. it is not meant to present a definitive solution for this kind of work. you will need to adjust parameters according to the dataset you are working with.
#eukaryotic species vary greatly in the length of different regions of the 18s gene, and doing any kind of trimming or truncation will exclude clades that have longer sequenced regions (for example, the V4 region we normally sequence is quite variable in length)
#but it's also sometimes necessary to truncate your reads with dada2 to retain enough reads for analysis, so you will need to balance these two things against each other when using this pipeline.
#best practices for 18s reads in our lab will involve the analysis of both merged and forward read sets separately, to identify clades excluded by any truncation/trimming done prior to merging.

#it's necessary to filter out low-abundance/prevalence ASVs after constructing the sequence table in dada2. dada2 developers do not provide any advice on this front, but the process is outlined below in the section after sequence table construction

#our standard procedure with 18s reads processed with dada2 will be to do an analysis with both the merged reads and the R1s only, to make sure we aren't missing any important clades that have V4 regions too long to merge
#code for the R1-only analysis procedure follows the merged read procedure in this guide (see bottom of file)

####Dependencies and Requirements####
#the pipeline requires that you begin with demultiplexed, gzipped fastq files (one fastq per sample)

####IMPORTANT EXPERIMENT-SPECIFIC INFO####
#Unless otherwise noted by the sequencing facility, all datasets should be primer-trimmed. There is code below to primer trim your files. However, if you need additional help there is further documentation and explanation of primer trimming with dada2 in their recommended ITS sequence processing pipeline.

####Libraries####
library(dada2)
library(phyloseq)
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape2)
library(stringr)
library(data.table)
library(broom)
library(ape)
library(qualpalr)
library(viridis)
library(ShortRead)
library(Biostrings)
library(seqinr)

####Environment Setup####
theme_set(theme_bw())
setwd("/projects/my_project/18s/")

####File Path Setup####
#this is so dada2 can quickly iterate through all the R1 and R2 files in your read set
path <- "/projects/my_project/18s/data/raw_data/" # CHANGE ME to the directory containing the fastq files
list.files(path)
fnFs <- sort(list.files(path, pattern="_R1_001.fastq.gz", full.names = TRUE)) #change the pattern to match all your R1 files
fnRs <- sort(list.files(path, pattern="_R2_001.fastq.gz", full.names = TRUE))
sample.names <- sapply(strsplit(basename(fnFs), "_"), `[`, 1) #change the delimiter in quotes and the number at the end of this command to decide how to split up the file name, and which element to extract for a unique sample name

####fastq Quality Plots####
plotQualityProfile(fnFs[1:20]) #this plots the quality profiles for each sample, if you have a lot of samples, it's best to look at just a few of them, the plots take a minute or two to generate even only showing 10-20 samples.
plotQualityProfile(fnRs[1:20])

####Primer Removal####
####identify primers####
FWD <- "GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA"  ## CHANGE ME to your forward primer sequence
REV <- "CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT"  ## CHANGE ME to your reverse primer sequence

  # Counts number of reads in which the primer is found
  nhits <- vcountPattern(primer, sread(readFastq(fn)), fixed = FALSE)
  return(sum(nhits > 0))
}
index <- 5 #this is the index of the file we want to check for primers, within the lists "fn*s.filtN", it can be any number from 1 to N, where N is the number of samples you are processing
rbind(FWD.ForwardReads = sapply(FWD.orients, primerHits, fn = fnFs.filtN[[index]]), #the index of the sample you'd like to use for this test is used here (your first sample may be a blank/control and not have many sequences in it, be mindful of this)
      FWD.ReverseReads = sapply(FWD.orients, primerHits, fn = fnRs.filtN[[index]]), 
      REV.ForwardReads = sapply(REV.orients, primerHits, fn = fnFs.filtN[[index]]), 
      REV.ReverseReads = sapply(REV.orients, primerHits, fn = fnRs.filtN[[index]]))

####OPTIONAL!!!!####
REV <- REV.orients[["RevComp"]] #IMPORTANT!!! change orientation ONLY IF NECESSARY. see the dada2 ITS_workflow guide section "Identify Primers" for details. it is linked at the top of this guide.

#### primer removal ####
cutadapt <- "/usr/local/bin/cutadapt" # CHANGE ME to the cutadapt path on your machine

}
#sanity check, should report zero for all orientations and read sets
index <- 5 #this is the index of the file we want to check for primers, within the lists "fn*s.cut", it can be any number from 1 to N, where N is the number of samples you are processing
rbind(FWD.ForwardReads = sapply(FWD.orients, primerHits, fn = fnFs.cut[[index]]), 
      FWD.ReverseReads = sapply(FWD.orients, primerHits, fn = fnRs.cut[[index]]), 
      REV.ForwardReads = sapply(REV.orients, primerHits, fn = fnFs.cut[[index]]), 
      REV.ReverseReads = sapply(REV.orients, primerHits, fn = fnRs.cut[[index]]))

# Forward and reverse fastq filenames have the format:
cutFs <- sort(list.files(path.cut, pattern = "R1", full.names = TRUE)) #remember to change this so it matches ALL your file names!
cutRs <- sort(list.files(path.cut, pattern = "R2", full.names = TRUE)) #remember to change this so it matches ALL your file names!

####filter and trim reads####
filtFs <- file.path(path.cut, "filtered", basename(cutFs))
filtRs <- file.path(path.cut, "filtered", basename(cutRs))

####trim & filter####
#filter and trim command. dada2 can canonically handle lots of errors, I am typically permissive in the maxEE parameter set here, in order to retain the maximum number of reads possible. error correction steps built into the dada2 pipeline have no trouble handling data with this many expected errors.
#it is best, after primer removal, to not truncate with 18s data, or with data from any region in which the length is broadly variable. you may exclude organisms that have a shorter insert than the truncation length (definitely possible, good example is giardia). defining a minimum sequence length is best.
#150 should be well below the lower bound for V4 data
#if you are working with V9 data, I have found that a minLen of 80bp is appropriate. Giardia sequences are ~95bp in V9
out <- filterAndTrim(cutFs, filtFs, cutRs, filtRs, truncLen=c(0,0), minLen = c(150,120),
                     maxN=c(0,0), maxEE=c(8,10), truncQ=c(2,2), rm.phix=TRUE, matchIDs=TRUE,
                     compress=TRUE, multithread=TRUE)
retained <- as.data.frame(out)
retained$percentage_retained <- retained$reads.out/retained$reads.in*100
View(retained)

####learn error rates####
#the next three sections (learn error rates, dereplication, sample inference) are the core of dada2's sequence processing pipeline. read the dada2 paper and their online documentation (linked at top of this guide) for more information on how these steps work
errF <- learnErrors(filtFs, multithread=TRUE)
errR <- learnErrors(filtRs, multithread=TRUE)

plotErrors(errF, nominalQ=TRUE) #assess this graph. it shows the error rates observed in your dataset. strange or unexpected shapes in the plot should be considered before moving on.

####dereplication####
derepFs <- derepFastq(filtFs, verbose=TRUE)
derepRs <- derepFastq(filtRs, verbose=TRUE)

# Name the derep-class objects by the sample names #this is just to ensure that all your R objects have the same sample names in them
names(derepFs) <- sample.names
names(derepRs) <- sample.names

####sample inference####
dadaFs <- dada(derepFs, err=errF, multithread=TRUE)
dadaRs <- dada(derepRs, err=errR, multithread=TRUE)

dadaFs[[1]]
dadaRs[[1]]

####OPTIONAL: remove low-sequence samples before merging####
#a "subscript out of bounds" error at the next step (merging) may indicate that you aren't merging any reads in one or more samples.
#NB, NOT getting this error doesn't necessarily mean that all of your samples end up with more than 0 merged reads, as i found out while processing a large 18s dataset. your guess is as good as mine as to why this error does or does not appear, but filtering out the samples that cause it is necessary for completion of the pipeline.
#samples_to_keep <- as.numeric(out[,"reads.out"]) > 100 #example of simple method used above after the filter and trim step. if you already did this but still got an error when merging, try the steps below
getN <- function(x) sum(getUniques(x)) #keeping track of read retention, number of unique sequences after ASV inference
track <- cbind(sapply(derepFs, getN), sapply(derepRs, getN), sapply(dadaFs, getN), sapply(dadaRs, getN))
samples_to_keep <- track[,4] > 50 #your threshold. try different ones to get the lowest one that will work. #this method accounts for dereplication/ASVs left after inference
samples_to_remove <- names(samples_to_keep)[which(samples_to_keep == FALSE)] #record names of samples you have the option of removing

####merge paired reads####
mergers <- mergePairs(dadaFs, derepFs, dadaRs, derepRs, verbose=TRUE) #a "subscript out of bounds" error here may indicate that you aren't merging any reads in one or more samples. you can remove samples with low counts from the workflow before the filterAndTrim step (a few steps back), or you can filter samples using the information from the dereplication and sample-inference steps (section just above)
#OPTIONAL: modify command if removing low-sequence samples
mergers <- mergePairs(dadaFs[samples_to_keep], derepFs[samples_to_keep], dadaRs[samples_to_keep], derepRs[samples_to_keep], verbose=TRUE)
# Inspect the merger data.frame from the first sample
head(mergers[[1]])

####construct sequence table####
seqtab <- makeSequenceTable(mergers)
dim(seqtab)

####View Sequence Length Distribution Post-Merging####
#most useful with merged data. this plot will not show you much for forward reads only, which should have a uniform length distribution.
length.histogram <- as.data.frame(table(nchar(getSequences(seqtab)))) #tabulate sequence length distribution
plot(x=length.histogram[,1], y=length.histogram[,2]) #view length distribution plot

####remove low-count singleton ASVs####
#create phyloseq otu_table
otus <- otu_table(t(seqtab), taxa_are_rows = TRUE)

#some metrics from the sequence table
otu_pres_abs <- otus
otu_pres_abs[otu_pres_abs >= 1] <- 1 #creating a presence/absence table
otu_pres_abs_rowsums <- rowSums(otu_pres_abs) #counts of sample per ASV
length(otu_pres_abs_rowsums) #how many ASVs
length(which(otu_pres_abs_rowsums == 1)) #how many ASVs only present in one sample

#what are the counts of each ASV
otu_rowsums <- rowSums(otus) #raw counts per ASV
otu_singleton_rowsums <- as.data.frame(otu_rowsums[which(otu_pres_abs_rowsums == 1)]) #raw read counts in ASVs only presesnt in one sample
hist(otu_singleton_rowsums[,1], breaks=500, xlim = c(0,200), xlab="# Reads in ASV") #histogram plot of above
length(which(otu_singleton_rowsums <= 1)) #how many are there with N reads or fewer? (N=1 in example)

#IF you want to filter out rare variants (low-read-count singleton ASVs) you can use phyloseq's "transform_sample_counts" to create a relative abundance table, and then filter your ASVs by choosing a threshold of relative abundance: otus_rel_ab = transform_sample_counts(otus, function(x) x/sum(x))
dim(seqtab) # sanity check
dim(otus) # (this should be the same as last command, but the dimensions reversed)
otus_rel_ab <- transform_sample_counts(otus, function(x) x/sum(x)) #create relative abundance table
df <- as.data.frame(unclass(otus_rel_ab)) #convert to plain data frame
df[is.na(df)] <- 0 #if there are samples with no merged reads in them, and they passed the merge step (a possiblity, converting to a relative abundance table produes all NaNs for that sample. these need to be set to zero so we can do the calculations in the next steps.)
otus_rel_ab.rowsums <- rowSums(df) #compute row sums (sum of relative abundances per ASV. for those only present in one sample, this is a value we can use to filter them for relative abundance on a per-sample basis)
a <- which(as.data.frame(otu_pres_abs_rowsums) == 1) #which ASVs are only present in one sample
b <- which(otus_rel_ab.rowsums <= 0.001) #here is where you set your relative abundance threshold #which ASVs pass our filter for relative abundance
length(intersect(a,b)) #how many of our singleton ASVs fail on this filter
rows_to_remove <- intersect(a,b) #A also in B (we remove singleton ASVs that have a lower relative abundance value than our threshold)
otus_filt <- otus[-rows_to_remove,] #filter OTU table we created earlier
dim(otus_filt) #how many ASVs did you retain?
seqtab.nosingletons <- t(as.matrix(unclass(otus_filt))) #convert filtered OTU table back to a sequence table matrix to continue with dada2 pipeline

####remove chimeras####
#here we remove "bimeras" or chimeras with two sources. look at "method" to decide which type of pooling you'd like to use when judging each sequence as chimeric or non-chimeric
seqtab.nosingletons.nochim <- removeBimeraDenovo(seqtab.nosingletons, method="pooled", multithread=TRUE, verbose=TRUE) #this step can take a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the size of your dataset
dim(seqtab.nosingletons.nochim)
sum(seqtab.nosingletons.nochim)/sum(seqtab.nosingletons) #proportion of nonchimeras #it should be relatively high after filtering out your singletons/low-count ASVs, even if you lose a lot of ASVs, the number of reads lost should be quite low

####track read retention through steps####
getN <- function(x) sum(getUniques(x))
track <- cbind(out[samples_to_keep,], sapply(dadaFs[samples_to_keep], getN), sapply(dadaRs[samples_to_keep], getN), sapply(mergers, getN), rowSums(seqtab.nosingletons), rowSums(seqtab.nosingletons.nochim))
# If processing only a single sample, remove the sapply calls: e.g. replace sapply(dadaFs, getN) with getN(dadaFs)
track <- cbind(track, 100-track[,6]/track[,5]*100, 100-track[,7]/track[,6]*100, track[,7]/track[,1]*100)

####assign taxonomy####
#note, this takes ages if you have a large dataset. strongly recommend doing on a multi-core machine (zoology cluster, or entamoeba in the lab). another option: saving the sequences as a fasta file (with writeFasta) and using QIIME's taxonomy assignment command will save you time, and is only slightly less accurate than the dada2 package's taxonomy assignment function (their implementation of RDP).

####fastq Quality Plots####
plotQualityProfile(fnFs[1:20]) #this plots the quality profiles for each sample, if you have a lot of samples, it's best to look at just a few of them, the plots take a minute or two to generate even only showing 10-20 samples.

      REV.ForwardReads = sapply(REV.orients, primerHits, fn = fnFs.filtN[[index]]))

####OPTIONAL!!!!####
REV <- REV.orients[["RevComp"]] #IMPORTANT!!! change orientation ONLY IF NECESSARY. see the dada2 ITS_workflow guide section "Identify Primers" for details. it is linked at the top of this guide.

#### primer removal ####

####filter and trim reads####
filtFs <- file.path(path.cut, "filtered", basename(cutFs))

####filter and trim reads####
#adjusting the parameters for the filterAndTrim function are crucial to the success of a dada2 run. truncation length, in particular, will be a strong determinant of the percentage of reads you retain per sample
#the parameters below represent best-practices from several different 18s experiments that we have done, tips from Ramon Masanna's lab, and parameters we have observed in published literature. the truncation length will need to be adjusted for the sequencing technology, of course. this example truncation length is OK for good quality MiSeq data.
out <- filterAndTrim(cutFs, filtFs, truncLen=c(0), minLen = c(150),
                     maxN=c(0), maxEE=c(8), truncQ=c(2), rm.phix=TRUE, matchIDs=TRUE,
                     compress=TRUE, multithread=TRUE) #with trunQ filter

####learn error rates####
#the next three sections (learn error rates, dereplication, sample inference) are the core of dada2's sequence processing pipeline. read the dada2 paper and their online documentation (linked at top of this guide) for more information on how these steps work
errF <- learnErrors(filtFs, multithread=TRUE)
plotErrors(errF, nominalQ=TRUE) #assess this graph. it shows the error rates observed in your dataset. strange or unexpected shapes in the plot should be considered before moving on.

####dereplication####
derepFs <- derepFastq(filtFs, verbose=TRUE)

# Name the derep-class objects by the sample names #this is just to ensure that all your R objects have the same sample names in them
names(derepFs) <- sample.names

####sample inference####
dadaFs <- dada(derepFs, err=errF, multithread=TRUE)
dadaFs[[1]]

####construct sequence table####
seqtab <- makeSequenceTable(dadaFs)
dim(seqtab)

#the remainder of the process from the point of sequence table creation remains the same for both R1 and merged procedures, see above section.
